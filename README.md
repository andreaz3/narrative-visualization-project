# Narrative Visualization Project

This interactive web-based narrative visualization explores the demographic enrollment trends at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's Grainger College of Engineering over the past decade. Utilizing data sourced from the UIUC [Division of Management Information](https://www.dmi.illinois.edu/stuenr/#race), the project compares the trends in the engineering school with other colleges within the university. Through dynamic pie and line charts, users can engage with the data to observe changes from 2013, 2018, and 2023. The visualization aims to highlight disparities and progress in demographic representation, encouraging a deeper understanding of diversity within the engineering field.

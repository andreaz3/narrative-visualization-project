        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to a narrative visualization on demographic trends within UIUC's Grainger School of Engineering and selected colleges. This visualization aims to explore and analyze gender and racial diversity across the past ten years by looking at <a href="https://www.dmi.illinois.edu/stuenr/#race">official UIUC enrollment data</a> from 2013, 2018, and 2023.</p>
        <p>The focus is on understanding disparities and improvements within the school of engineering and comparing these trends with other selected colleges to provide a comprehensive view of educational diversity.</p>
        <p>Dive in to explore the data, see the trends unfold, and uncover the story behind the numbers.</p>

    <div class="slide" id="slide-2013" style="margin: 20px;">
        <h2>Year 2013</h2>
        <p>Approximately 10 years ago, the demographic landscape of the engineering college unsurpsingly showed a strong representation of certain groups. It was predominantly male and caucasian. Notably, the percentage of women and underrepresented racial groups was lower compared to other colleges, possibly reflecting historical trends or barriers in the field.</p>
        <p>The following charts will help us understand the baseline from which we measure progress. You can select a different college for comparison to see how the enrollment demographic at the school of engineering differs from that of other colleges. You can hover over pie slices to see a more detailed breakdown and you may scroll down to the annotations to view the exact numerical differences between the pie slices.</p>
        <div class="selection">
            <label for="comparison-college-2013">Select College for Comparison:</label>

    <div class="slide" id="slide-2018" style="margin: 20px;">
        <h2>Year 2018</h2>
        <p>In five years, we observe a slight decrease in the dominant identities for the school of engineering. Notably, the percentage of men decreased from 84% to 77% and the percentage of caucasians decreased from 45% to 38%. However, from viewing the pie charts and comparing to other colleges, it is clear that the disparities in representation remain.</p>
        <div class="selection">
            <label for="comparison-college-2018">Select College for Comparison:</label>
            <select id="comparison-college-2018"></select>
        </div>
        <div class="chart-container" id="chart-container-2018"></div>
        <div class="annotations" id="annotations-2018"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="slide" id="slide-2023" style="margin: 20px;">
        <h2>Year 2023</h2>
        <p>5 years later, we arrive in today's time. Just last year in 2023, it was observed that caucasians were no longer the majority in the school of engineering. Making up 30% of the enrollment, it was surpassed by the 32% of Asian Americans. Other than this, other minority categories have mostly remained the same or had a slight increase.</p>
        <div class="selection">
            <label for="comparison-college-2023">Select College for Comparison:</label>
            <select id="comparison-college-2023"></select>

        <div class="annotations" id="annotations-2023"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="slide" id="slide-conclusion" style="margin: 20px;">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The lines graphs below provide an overview of the Grainger College of Engineering enrollments by gender and by race in the last 10 years, summarizing what we have learned in the previous slides as well as allowing us to see the trends over time.</p>
        <p>Feel free to mouse-over data points to see exact enrollment numbers and years.</p>
        <div id="summary-chart-container"></div>
        <div id="racial-summary-chart-container"></div>
        <p>Although there have been slight improvements in the number of enrollments among minority groups, no significant changes have occurred except for an increase in Asian American enrollments, highlighting the need for continued efforts to address disparities among genders and races.</p>
